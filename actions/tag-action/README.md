| `dry-run`      | Run the action in dry-run mode. No changes will be pushed to the repository. Useful for testing workflows.                                                       | No       | `false` |

| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `created-tag` | The tag that was created. |

## Additional Information

### Dry-Run Mode

When `dry-run` is set to `true`, the action will simulate the tag creation or deletion process without making any actual changes. This is useful for testing and debugging workflows.

### Force Create

If `force-create` is set to `true`, the action will overwrite an existing tag with the same name. This is useful when you need to update a tag with new changes.

### Delete Tag

When `delete-tag` is set to `true`, the action will delete the specified tag from both the local repository and the remote repository. The `delete-message` input can be used to customize the commit message for the deletion.

## Example Configuration

Below is an example of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Manage Git Tags

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  tag-management:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: main

      - name: Create a New Tag
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/tag-action@main
        with:
          ref: main
          tag-name: v1.0.0
          create-tag: true

      - name: Delete an Existing Tag
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/tag-action@main
        with:
          ref: main
          tag-name: v1.0.0
          delete-tag: true
          dry-run: true
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `ref` input matches the branch you want to work on.
- Use `dry-run` mode to test the workflow without making changes.
- The `force-create` input can be used to overwrite existing tags, but use it cautiously to avoid unintended changes.
