## How to Use

Below is a general example of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Cleanup Old Packages

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Runs weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      threshold-days:
        description: "Number of days to keep package versions"
        required: false
        default: "7"
      included-tags:
        description: "Tags to include for deletion"
        required: false
        default: ""
      excluded-tags:
        description: "Tags to exclude from deletion"
        required: false
        default: "release*"
      dry-run:
        description: "Enable dry-run mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Package Cleanup Action
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/container-package-cleanup@main
        with:
          threshold-days: ${{ github.event.inputs.threshold-days }}
          included-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.included-tags }}
          excluded-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.excluded-tags }}
          debug: ${{ github.event.inputs.debug }}
          dry-run: ${{ github.event.inputs.dry-run }}
          package-type: container # or maven
        env:
          PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
```

---

## Usage for Container Images

- Set `package-type: container` (default).
- Filtering by `included-tags` and `excluded-tags` works on image tags.
- Wildcards (`*`) are supported for flexible tag matching.
- All container image versions older than `threshold-days` and matching the tag filters will be deleted (unless `dry-run` is enabled).

---

## Usage for Maven Packages

- Set `package-type: maven`.
- Filtering by `included-tags` and `excluded-tags` works on Maven version names.
- **If you do not specify `included-tags`, the action will automatically add `*SNAPSHOT*` to the list of included patterns for Maven packages.**  
  This means that by default, only SNAPSHOT versions will be deleted for Maven, unless you specify other include patterns.
- Wildcards (`*`) are supported for flexible version matching.
- All Maven versions older than `threshold-days` and matching the filters will be deleted (unless `dry-run` is enabled).

**Example for Maven:**

```yaml
- name: Run Maven Package Cleanup
  uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/container-package-cleanup@main
  with:
    threshold-days: 14
    included-tags: "*SNAPSHOT*"
    excluded-tags: "release*"
    package-type: maven
  env:
    PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
```

## Tag/Version Filtering Logic

The action filters tags/versions in the following order of priority:

1. **Excluded Tags/Versions**:
   - Versions matching `excluded-tags` are **always skipped**, even if they also match `included-tags`.

2. **Included Tags/Versions**:
   - If `included-tags` is specified, only versions matching `included-tags` are considered for deletion.

3. **Default Behavior**:
   - If `included-tags` is empty, all versions are considered for deletion, except those explicitly excluded by `excluded-tags`.
   - **For Maven:** If `included-tags` is empty, only `*SNAPSHOT*` versions are considered for deletion by default.

#### Filtering Process

1. Exclude versions matching `excluded-tags`.
2. From the remaining versions, include only those matching `included-tags` (if specified).
3. If `included-tags` is not specified, all remaining versions are considered for deletion (for Maven, only `*SNAPSHOT*` by default).

## Wildcard Matching

Supported patterns for tags/versions:

| Pattern      | Matches                              | Does Not Match |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `release*`   | `release`, `release-v1`              | `v1-release`   |
| `*release`   | `v1-release`, `candidate-release`    | `release-v1`   |
| `*release*`  | `v1-release-candidate`, `release-v1` | `v1-candidate` |
| `release*v1` | `release-v1`, `release-candidate-v1` | `release-v2`   |

---

## Debug & Dry-Run Modes

- **Debug Mode:** Set `debug: true` to log detailed information about the filtering and deletion process.
- **Dry-Run Mode:** Set `dry-run: true` to simulate deletions without actually removing any versions.
