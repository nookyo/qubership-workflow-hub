## How to Use

Below are examples of how to use this action in a GitHub Actions workflow for both Docker images and Maven JAR files:

### Example for Docker Images

```yaml
name: Cleanup Old Docker Images

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      threshold-days:
        description: "Number of days to keep Docker image versions"
        required: false
        default: "7"
      included-tags:
        description: "Tags to include for deletion"
        required: false
        default: ""
      excluded-tags:
        description: "Tags to exclude from deletion"
        required: false
        default: ""
      debug:
        description: "Enable debug mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"
      dry-run:
        description: "Enable dry-run mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Docker Cleanup Action
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/container-package-cleanup@main
        with:
          threshold-days: ${{ github.event.inputs.threshold-days || 7 }}
          included-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.included-tags || '' }}
          excluded-tags: ${{ github.event.inputs.excluded-tags || '' }}
          debug: ${{ github.event.inputs.debug || 'false' }}
          dry-run: ${{ github.event.inputs.dry-run || 'false' }}
          package-type: container
        env:
          PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
```

### Example for Maven JAR Files

```yaml
name: Cleanup Old Maven JAR Files

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      threshold-days:
        description: "Number of days to keep Maven JAR versions"
        required: false
        default: "14"
      included-patterns:
        description: "Patterns to include for deletion"
        required: false
        default: "*SNAPSHOT*"
      excluded-patterns:
        description: "Patterns to exclude from deletion"
        required: false
        default: "release*"
      debug:
        description: "Enable debug mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"
      dry-run:
        description: "Enable dry-run mode"
        required: false
        default: "false"

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Maven Cleanup Action
        uses: netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/container-package-cleanup@main
        with:
          threshold-days: ${{ github.event.inputs.threshold-days || 14 }}
          included-patterns: ${{ github.event.inputs.included-patterns || '*SNAPSHOT*' }}
          excluded-patterns: ${{ github.event.inputs.excluded-patterns || 'release*' }}
          debug: ${{ github.event.inputs.debug || 'false' }}
          dry-run: ${{ github.event.inputs.dry-run || 'false' }}
          package-type: maven
        env:
          PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
```

## Usage for Container Images

- Set `package-type: container` (default).
- Filtering by `included-tags` and `excluded-tags` works on image tags.
- Wildcards (`*`) are supported for flexible tag matching.
- All container image versions older than `threshold-days` and matching the tag filters will be deleted (unless `dry-run` is enabled).

---

## Usage for Maven Packages

- Set `package-type: maven`.
- Filtering by `included-patterns` and `excluded-patterns` works on Maven version names.
- **If you do not specify `included-patterns`, the action will automatically add `*SNAPSHOT*` to the list of included patterns for Maven packages.**
  This means that by default, only SNAPSHOT versions will be deleted for Maven, unless you specify other include patterns.
- Wildcards (`*`) are supported for flexible version matching.
- All Maven versions older than `threshold-days` and matching the filters will be deleted (unless `dry-run` is enabled).

---

## Tag/Version Filtering Logic

The action filters tags/versions in the following order of priority:

1. **Excluded Tags/Patterns**:
   - Versions matching `excluded-tags` or `excluded-patterns` are **always skipped**, even if they also match `included-tags` or `included-patterns`.

2. **Included Tags/Patterns**:
   - If `included-tags` or `included-patterns` is specified, only versions matching these are considered for deletion.

3. **Default Behavior**:
   - If neither `included-tags` nor `included-patterns` is specified, all versions are considered for deletion, except those explicitly excluded by `excluded-tags` or `excluded-patterns`.
   - **For Maven:** If neither `included-tags` or `included-patterns` is specified, only `*SNAPSHOT*` versions are considered for deletion by default.

#### Filtering Process

1. Exclude versions matching `excluded-tags` or `excluded-patterns`.
2. From the remaining versions, include only those matching `included-tags` or `included-patterns` (if specified).
3. If neither `included-tags` nor `included-patterns` is specified, all remaining versions are considered for deletion (for Maven, only `*SNAPSHOT*` by default).

| `sha256:*`     | Starts with "sha256:" (for image digests)       | `sha256:abc123def456`                                                                                |

## Debug & Dry-Run Modes

- **Debug Mode:** Set `debug: true` to log detailed information about the filtering and deletion process.
- **Dry-Run Mode:** Set `dry-run: true` to simulate deletions without actually removing any versions.
