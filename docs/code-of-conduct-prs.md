| Scope / Project | Path or component                                                                    | `actions/metadata-action`            |
| Issue           | `Fixes #342`                                                                         | `Fixes #342`                         |
| Summary         | 1–3 lines what & why                                                                 | "Add dry-run preview mode"           |

| Breaking        | Yes/No (+ migration if Yes)                                                          | `No`                                 |
| Evidence        | Test run, log snippet, rationale                                                     | "Existing tests cover"               |
| Labels          | One+ classification label                                                            | `feature`                            |

Template:

```md
### Summary

<what & why>

### Issue

Fixes #<id>

### Type

feat | fix | docs | refactor | chore | perf | ci | build | test | deprecate | revert

### Breaking Change?

No

### Scope / Project

<component>
### Implementation Notes
<optional>
### Tests / Evidence
<how verified>
### Additional Notes
<optional>
```

### Title Rules

Format: `<type>(optional-scope): imperative statement` (≤ 72 chars, no trailing period, no issue number).
Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, ci, build, chore, revert, deprecate.
Good: `fix(container-package-cleanup): handle 403 errors`.

---

## 3. Labels (Quick)

Primary: feature, enhancement, bug, documentation, refactor.
Supporting: ci, perf, question, help wanted, good first issue, wontfix, duplicate, invalid.
Rule: pick ONE primary; do not mix feature + enhancement. Behaviour change ≠ refactor.

---

## 4. Issue Linking

Always link an issue (except trivial typo). Use auto-close keywords:
`Fixes #123` / `Closes #123`; use `Related to #456` for non-closing references.
No issue? Create it first with context + acceptance criteria.

---

## 5. Quality & Review

| Aspect        | Expectation                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Style         | Follow existing patterns; no mass reformat  |
| Security      | No new secrets; minimal permissions         |
| Compatibility | Avoid breaking change or document migration |
| Tests         | Cover new logic OR justify absence          |
| Commits       | Prefer squash (clean history)               |
| Diff          | Only related changes                        |

Review Flow: Draft (early) → Fill template → Add labels → Request reviewers → Address comments (amend) → All checks green → Final title/summary pass → Merge.

## 6. Example PR (Good)

Real example: https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub/pull/293

```md
### Summary

Add 'dry-run' input to metadata-action to allow safe preview of computed tags.

### Issue

Fixes #342

### Type

feat

### Breaking Change?

No

### Scope / Project

actions/metadata-action

### Implementation Notes

Adds optional input `dry-run`; skips tag push when true. Updated README.

### Tests / Evidence

Manual run in fork (logs). Existing computation test still passes.
```

## 7. Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason                        | Fix                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| No linked issue               | Add `Fixes #id`                  |
| Title not conventional        | Rephrase to `<type>(scope): ...` |
| Missing labels                | Add primary type label           |
| Undocumented new input/output | Update README / conventions      |
| Hidden breaking change        | Add section + migration notes    |
| Excess unrelated changes      | Split into separate PRs          |
| Opaque branch name            | Rename or clarify in summary     |

---

## 8. After Merge

| Action                           | When                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Confirm auto-closed issue        | Immediately            |
| Update changelog / release notes | Feature / fix merge    |
| Tag action version (if changed)  | Post-merge validation  |
| Announce deprecation (if any)    | Before tagging         |
| Delete merged branch             | Once rollback risk low |

Support: questions → issue with `documentation` label.

Consistent hygiene keeps reviews fast and predictable.
