# Qubership Workflow Hub

A comprehensive collection of reusable GitHub Actions and Workflows, designed to streamline your CI/CD pipelines and development processes.

## üîç Overview

### What this hub solves
Common CI/CD tasks (tagging, semantic / metadata version generation, artifact & package publishing, Helm chart release, cleanup, event triggering) are often re‚Äëimplemented inconsistently across repositories. This hub centralises those patterns so teams get:
* One vetted implementation instead of N ad‚Äëhoc scripts
* Predictable inputs/outputs and error behaviour
* Pinned version strategy and upgrade path
* Reduced maintenance surface in product repositories

### Core components
| Component | Role | Location |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actions | Single, composable steps (JS or composite) | `actions/<name>/` |
| Reusable workflows | Multi‚Äëjob orchestration via `workflow_call` | `docs/reusable/*.md` (docs) / `.github/workflows` (source when defined) |
| Conventions | Cross‚Äëcutting rules (naming, security, versioning) | `docs/conventions.md` |
| Guides / Tutorials | Onboarding & process | `docs/*.md` |

### Principles
| Principle | Summary | Practical outcome |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Determinism | Pin majors or SHAs | Reproducible builds |
| Least privilege | Start with `contents: read` only | Reduced token blast radius |
| Composability | Small, focused actions | Easier orchestration in workflows |
| Backwards compatibility | Major tag stable; break only with major bump | Safe incremental upgrades |
| Observability | Summaries & clear outputs | Quick diagnosis and audit trail |
| Explicit deprecation | Mark + replacement path | Predictable migration window |

### When to use what
| Need | Use an Action | Use a Reusable Workflow |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|
| One operation (tag, compute version, cleanup) | ‚úì |  |
| Multi-step, multi-job orchestration (build + test + publish) |  | ‚úì |
| Want to hide complexity behind a simple call | Possibly (if single job) | ‚úì |
| Need to expose inputs/secrets/outputs contract to consumers | ‚úì | ‚úì |

### Versioning & deprecation (short form)
* Prefer `@v1` major (receives backward-compatible fixes) or full commit SHA for high-integrity steps.
* Deprecated components list a replacement; removal only after communicated grace period.

### Security baseline
* Minimal default permissions; elevate only per job requiring write.
* Dry-run & debug flags (where available) for safe trial.
* Encourage immutable references (SHAs) in critical release pipelines.

### Extending the hub
1. Draft a new action locally (composite or JS) under `actions/<name>/`.
2. Provide README (purpose, inputs, outputs, minimal example, failure modes).
3. Add to Actions index; add workflow docs if orchestration required.
4. Create `v1` tag and (optionally) publish SHA example for security-sensitive consumers.
5. Update conventions if introducing a new cross-cutting rule.

This structured approach keeps product repositories lean while providing a dependable automation toolkit.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nookyo/qubership-workflow-hub.git
   cd qubership-workflow-hub
   ```

2. **Explore Actions and Workflows**
   - Browse the [`actions/`](actions/) folder for individual action packages.
   - Browse the [`docs/reusable/`](docs/reusable/) folder for workflow templates.

3. **Use an Action**
   Reference an action in your own workflow YAML:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     tag:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Create a Git Tag
           uses: nookyo/qubership-workflow-hub/actions/tag-action@main
           with:
             tag-prefix: "v"
             tag-message: "Release {{version}}"
   ```

4. **Use a Reusable Workflow**
   Include a reusable workflow by path:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     release:
       uses: nookyo/qubership-workflow-hub/docs/reusable/release-drafter.md@main
       with:
         config-file: ".github/release-drafter.yml"
   ```
   > **Note:** Consult the individual workflow docs for specific input parameters and examples.

  ## üìò Conventions
  Shared patterns (naming, inputs, version pinning, permissions, security hardening) are documented in [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md).
